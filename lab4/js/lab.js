// Create a starting screen
   // Add a Start button, waiting for the player to press it
// After player presses start, bird begins to fall at a constant speed
   // If the player presses space, make the bird move up a little
   // Keep track of the score. Each second on screen equals a point. 
// Every 2 seconds, create two pipes, one extending from the bottom of the screen and the other from the top of the screen, with a gap the size of two birds length-wise in between them
// When the bird sprite hits a pipe, the game ends.
// Show the score on screen, with a Restart button below it 
// Return back to the starting screen after the player presses Restart
