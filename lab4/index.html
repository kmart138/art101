			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Pseudocode a simple game with a list and sub-section of how the game works. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some of the code was hard to understand such as an indent in the listing order. Also a problem with starting java script.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The assignemnt went well, it was failr short and it included many useful coding skills i can use for my homepage. I put a good ammount of effort into this assignment. </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>

<p>Here is a list of the steps to create a simple game:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Create a starting screen</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Add a Start button, waiting for the player to press it</li>
	</ul>
	<li>After player presses start, bird begins to fall at a constant speed</li>
	<ul>
	<li>If the player presses space, make the bird move up a little</li>
	<li>Keep track of the score. Each second on screen equals a point.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Every 2 seconds, create two pipes, one extending from the bottom of the screen and the other from the top of the screen, with a gap the size of two birds length-wise in between them</li>
	<li>When the bird sprite hits a pipe, the game ends.</li>
	<li>Show the score on screen, with a Restart button below it</li>
	<li>Return back to the starting screen after the player presses Restart</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of the steps to create a résumé:</p>	
<ul>
	<li>Create a résumé</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Open a Google Document and name it Resume</li>
	<li>At the top, add your name, phone number, and email address</li>
	<li>Add any prior education such as a bachelor’s degree</li>
	<li>Add any prior certifications</li>
	<li>List past experiences or jobs</li>
	<li>If more content is needed, add awards, achievements, projects, or interests</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Find jobs on Indeed, Linkedin, Handshake, and other job application platforms</li>
	<ul>
		On the website, search for keywords related to the job you are aiming for, such as “software developer” or “life guard”</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Pick out jobs that you would like to apply for</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Look at the requirements and see if they are a good fit for you</li>

	</ul>
	<li>Submit the application</li>
	<li>Wait for a response from the company</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a pseudocode list of the steps to create a simple game in java:</p>
					<pre><code>
// Create a starting screen
   	// Add a Start button, waiting for the player to press it
// After player presses start, bird begins to fall at a constant speed
   	// If the player presses space, make the bird move up a little
   	// Keep track of the score. Each second on screen equals a point. 
// Every 2 seconds, create two pipes, one extending from the bottom of the screen and the other from the top of the screen, with a gap the size of two birds length-wise in between them
// When the bird sprite hits a pipe, the game ends.
// Show the score on screen, with a Restart button below it 
// Return back to the starting screen after the player presses Restart
